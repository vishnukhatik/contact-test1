Initial Contacts Directory repository. 
Inside the contacts-app folder is a readme of todos on the frontend side

Generally we need to integrate the frontend and backend to create a contacts app system.

Tasks
- Integrate the backend API to the frontend react app, so it responds properly for each action that occurs in the application.
- The Frontend should call the Backend API to fetch data. Use async/await and try/catch blocks as necessary. 
- It should also Create/Delete/Update the data on the backend (In Memory) for each action that is executed.
