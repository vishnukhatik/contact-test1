# TODO

- **Write the code using TypeScript**
- **Maintain responsive design**
- **Use flexbox to align page items**
- **Use the grid system of the component library selected in step two. Demonstrate using flexbox and the grid system together.
- **Install an open-source or create a list component to display ‘Contacts’.**
- **Use whatever ‘Contact’ attribute fields as you think appropriate.**
- **You may leave the Contacts data in memory.**
- **Use browser local storage, a local JSON file, or for double bonus use a free SASS based NoSQL store.
- **make the list sortable
- **make the list searchable
- **add pagination (backend handled)
- **Create a form for the ‘Contact’ that can be used for both creation and modification.**
- **Validate input on the form. 
- **Make the validation real-time, not dependent on submitting.
- **use a reducer for the validation.
- **Implement a custom hook for validation.
- **clearly and explicitly report the specific validation violations to the user.
- **Persist uncommitted data to local storage to mitigate user data loss.
- **Create view component/s for Adding, Modifying, and Deleting ‘Contact’ entities.**
- **implement a popular react component framework such as Material UI UX and other details are at your discretion.
- **Add a ‘Starred Contact’ feature with some facility to toggle that status. Make the list sortable by or view only ‘Stared’
- **Write the complete app with only functional components
- **Optimize your code**
- **Using Jest / react-testing-library, write unit tests for a list and a form component. 
- **Write as much functional test coverage as you think appropriate.**
- **Write a test for the CRUD control if implement it in a separate component.

Note: ** = Good to have
